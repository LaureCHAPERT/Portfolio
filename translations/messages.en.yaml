  concerto_description: Concert'o is a team project that allows you to filter the events listed on its platform by region and/or musical genre.
    platform. The front end is built in React and the back end in Symfony. The back office for accessing the CRUD is also managed in Symfony (the 'views' aspect being less complex than the front office).
    is aimed at regional or private organisations. The idea came about following the end of deconfinement and the increased need to return to a social life
    easily. Concert'o is a solution proposed in response to this desire. I was both front and back-end developer on this project.
  first_portfolio_description: Just after I'd got my pro title and finally wanted to shake up the habits I'd had with Symfony,
    I decided to do my first portfolio with Laravel. This project allowed me to familiarise myself with the basic concepts of the framework, in particular its
    its tree structure and its 'Artisan' tool, which lets you perform tasks similar to those of the Symfony conslole.
  second_portfolio_description: Developed with Symfony 7, this version represents a significant upgrade from
    my previous work with Symfony 6.3. Inspired by a carefully chosen colour palette, I've
    based on mock-ups designed on Figma. For total control and a return to basics,
    I opted for native CSS, including media queries, and JavaScript.
    I also took the time to test various libraries, such as SplideJS, to get as close as possible to my mock-ups.
